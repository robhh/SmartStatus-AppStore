SmartStatus Watch App
=====================

IMPORTANT: This is the version of SmartStatus that only works with the App Store version of Smartwatch+

The SmartStatus watch app only works in conjunction with the Smartwatch+ iOS app. [Smartwatch+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartwatch+-for-pebble/id711357931?ls=1&mt=8) is available on the Apple App Store.

This code provides an example of how to communicate with Smartwatch+ and how to use status information from your iOS device within your own watch face or app. The status information that is currently available to you through Smartwatch+ is

* Current weather
* iPhone battery percentage
* Currently playing song/artist
* Next calendar appointment
